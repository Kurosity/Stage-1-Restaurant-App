#### _Restaurant Reviews - Stage 1_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

This project is a mobile-ready web application for **Restaurant Reviews** that has the following:
  * Accessibility for screeen readers and offline use
  * Responsiveness on different sized displays 
  
The application displays a list of restaurants with another page displaying a selected restaurants associated details. A map of the restaurant location(s) is displayed on each page.

### How to Run on Localhost

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
3. Explore the provided code, and start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
4. Write code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.
